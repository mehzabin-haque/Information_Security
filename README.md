# Information Security Code 

## Introduction
This GitHub repository focuses on Information Security (IS) algorithms implemented in C++. It includes encryption algorithms, classic ciphers, and secure hashing techniques to safeguard data and enhance data security.

## Encryption Algorithms
1. AES with Single and Multiple Keys: Implementations of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for robust data encryption, supporting single and multiple keys for added security.
2. AES with CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): AES implementation with Cipher Block Chaining mode, ensuring enhanced confidentiality and integrity of data.
3. AES with CTR (Counter Mode): AES implementation with Counter Mode, offering efficient and secure data encryption and decryption.
4. AES with ECB (Electronic Codebook Mode): AES implementation with Electronic Codebook Mode, suitable for parallel processing.

## Classic Ciphers
1. Monoalphabetic Cipher: Code for implementing the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, a simple letter-to-letter substitution technique.
2. Polyalphabetic Cipher: Implementation of the polyalphabetic substitution cipher, a more complex version of the monoalphabetic cipher using multiple substitution alphabets.

## Polyalphabetic Cipher with Key
An enhanced version of the polyalphabetic cipher, allowing users to define their custom keys for improved security and uniqueness.

## SHA-512 Code
Implementation of the SHA-512 hashing algorithm, a widely-used cryptographic hash function, to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## Usage
Users can compile and run the C++ code for any of the algorithms listed above to understand and observe their functionality. The repository is organized with clear file names and detailed comments in the code to aid usage and comprehension.
